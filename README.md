# schonfeld_hkex

The main code for the data pull, cleaning and processing is in the following path
schonfeld_hkex/myapp/hkex.py

The webpage has been developed in Django and can be run in a local Python environment. In order to do so:
1. Open Anaconda prompt
2. Enter the directory of the repository
3. Run migration - python manage.py makemigrations
4. Run migration - python manage.py migrations
5. Run server - python manage.py runserver
6. Navigate into link indicated by console

Apologies, due to time constraints I wasn't able to deploy it into AWS and refine it as I was on holidays until this Monday.

Thank you!
Tiziano
